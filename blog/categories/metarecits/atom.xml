<p>Still, we were both done with the everyday routine of adhering to expectation syntax. Maybe too many expectations. Maybe too many failed examples from methods that took too damn long to load. Maybe boredom. Who knows. I don&rsquo;t. I just recall that we both commented craving a new form.</p>

<p>Instead of jetting back to the lab per usual, we decided to return to that RecursiveOpenStruct my friend Bundler managed to keep track of. I&rsquo;d forgotten all about that place, but Bundler remembered where it was and how to find it. He was like that, always helping me out by doing things a little outside of his everyday scope. A lot of people helped him out in the early days of his loving, so he&rsquo;s inherited a bit of attributes from the Giving class. Plus, he&rsquo;s developed some kind of dependency sixth sense and appreciates that I&rsquo;m almost always looking to build something new and useful. It was a co-dependent relationship that worked for the both us. So, I made a call. He responded: &ldquo;Anything for Ruby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Each arrival began with a song: a listening that helped us both traverse. I chose a DSL. I think it was Sinatra 1.4.6. It must have been. Sinatra always quickly created the perfect environment. It was as if that song was written specifically for this purpose: minimal effort, maximum return. Ruby appreciated that about me. She would get gitty every time I found it—that perfect beat. A few times she would .send(&ldquo;you always find the right gem.&rdquo;)</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/60ca0b30c96dfd5f36ec.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>$ cat respond.rb
# 2.times my_response
# my_response = &quot;I&#39;ve benefited from remembering good friends and good songs.&quot;
# put &quot;Sinatra installed!&quot;</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>Mid listen, Sinatra on shotgun and ActiveRecord in use, I put my hand in my pocket, habitually wanting to get my phone and take a photo. Instead, I sat down on the table and just watched her dance a while. I remembered that didn&rsquo;t need to do anything but see this. I really didn&rsquo;t need to capture every good memory of this arrival, or anything that would follow. More importantly, neither of us could ever really return to these moments anyway: to the first time she would glide by my hand; to the initial touch; to the inhale of the new table smell—forever transformed by our primitive obsession—and our collective choice to not fix it. She reminded me. This didn&rsquo;t need to persist in memory. It was enough to just be there: in those moments with each other.</p>

$ cat ruby_knows.rb
# him.send(&quot;we&#39;re not here to store anything. We&#39;re here to enjoy.each {|other| ... }&quot;)</code></pre></noscript></div>
